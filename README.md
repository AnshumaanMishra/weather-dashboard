Weather Dashboard project  
## About:
This website is a simple implementation of the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/), a free-to-use API used to fetch weather details from the web. The website fetches the weather of the entered location and displays it.  
The data can be configured to use either the Metric System or the Imperial System. The Metric system uses SI units, whereas the Imperial System uses the FPS unit system. They can be adjusted by the toggle with $^{\circ}C$ (or $^{\circ}F$) written on it.  
Further, this project allows the user to see the forecast for the entire week or only the real-time weather. This can be configured using the toggle with D (or W) written on it. <br>
